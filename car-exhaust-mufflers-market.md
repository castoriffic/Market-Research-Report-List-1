<p><strong>The Car Exhaust Mufflers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Mufflers</li><li>Reactive Mufflers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Car exhaust mufflers are designed to reduce the noise emitted by the engine. There are two main types of mufflers: absorptive mufflers and reactive mufflers. Absorptive mufflers work by channeling the exhaust gases through a series of chambers filled with sound-absorbing materials, such as fiberglass or steel wool. These materials absorb the sound waves, reducing the noise. Reactive mufflers, on the other hand, use a series of chambers and baffles to create sound waves that cancel out the noise produced by the engine, resulting in a quieter exhaust system.</p></p>
