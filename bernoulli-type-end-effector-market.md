<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bernoulli Type End-Effector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bernoulli Type End-Effector (Non-contact type)</li><li>Bernoulli Type End-Effector (Contact type)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Bernoulli Type End-Effector market comprises two types: the non-contact type and the contact type. The non-contact type utilizes the Bernoulli principle to generate a lifting force, allowing it to hold delicate objects without causing damage or contamination. It is commonly used in industries such as electronics and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, the contact type makes physical contact with the object to provide a gripping force. This type is typically deployed in applications that require a stronger and more secure hold, such as in automotive and packaging industries.</p></p>
