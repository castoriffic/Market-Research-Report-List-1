<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog X-ray Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analog X-ray systems refer to traditional methods of capturing and storing X-ray images. The market encompasses two types: film-based and CR (Computed Radiography) film cassette. In film-based systems, X-ray images are captured on photographic film, which is then developed and manually interpreted by radiologists. CR film cassette systems use a similar approach, but the X-ray image is stored digitally on a cassette instead of a physical film. Both types require physical handling and processing, with CR film cassette offering the advantage of digital storage for easier archiving and sharing of images.</p></p>
