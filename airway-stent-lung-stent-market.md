<p><h1>Airway Stent & Lung Stent Market Size: Evaluating its Market Trends, Growth, and Projections 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Airway Stent & Lung Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>An airway stent, also known as a lung stent, is a medical device used to widen constricted or blocked airways in the respiratory system. It is often used in conditions such as tracheobronchomalacia, tracheal stenosis, and lung cancer. The stent is typically made of metal, silicone, or a combination of both, and is inserted into the airway through a bronchoscope or a catheter-based delivery system.</p><p>The global airway stent & lung stent market is experiencing significant growth and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.6% during the forecast period. The increasing incidence of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, is one of the primary factors driving market growth. Additionally, the rising geriatric population, advancements in stent technology, and increasing awareness about minimally invasive procedures are further fueling market expansion.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the development of bioabsorbable airway stents. These stents are designed to gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for removal procedures. Bioabsorbable stents reduce the risk of complications associated with permanent stents, such as stent migration or granulation tissue formation.</p><p>Geographically, North America dominates the airway stent & lung stent market due to the high prevalence of respiratory diseases and the presence of well-established healthcare infrastructure. Asia Pacific is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period, driven by increasing healthcare expenditure, a growing patient population, and rising awareness about minimally invasive procedures.</p><p>Overall, the airway stent & lung stent market is poised for substantial growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as increasing respiratory diseases, advancements in stent technology, and the demand for minimally invasive procedures. The development of bioabsorbable stents also presents an exciting opportunity for market expansion.</p></p>
