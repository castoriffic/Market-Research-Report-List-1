<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Marking Coding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIJ</li><li>DOD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet marking coding machines are classified into two main types - Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) and Drop on Demand (DOD). CIJ machines use a continuous stream of ink droplets to mark products, offering fast and high-quality coding capabilities. DOD machines, on the other hand, eject individual ink droplets only when needed, resulting in precise and efficient coding. These machines play a crucial role in industries where products require clear and accurate markings, such as packaging and manufacturing sectors.</p></p>
