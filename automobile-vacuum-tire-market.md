<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Vacuum Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Slash Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automobile vacuum tire market primarily consists of two types: radial tires and slash tires. Radial tires are designed with cords placed at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, allowing for better flexibility and improved traction on various surfaces. They also offer enhanced fuel efficiency and longer tread life. On the other hand, slash tires have a diagonal pattern on the tread, promoting better grip on wet and snowy terrain. These tires are often preferred for off-road driving and provide better overall traction in challenging conditions.</p></p>
