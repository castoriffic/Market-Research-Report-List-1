<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OEM</li><li>Replacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle tire market can be divided into two main types: OEM and replacement market. The OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) market refers to tires that are supplied directly by manufacturers to vehicle manufacturers for use in new vehicles. The replacement market, on the other hand, involves tires that are sold separately to vehicle owners/operators as replacements for worn-out or damaged tires. This market is driven by factors like aging vehicles, tire wear, and road conditions, whereas the OEM market is closely linked to the production of new vehicles.</p></p>
