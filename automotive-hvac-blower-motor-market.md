<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive HVAC Blower Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed</li><li>Brushless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive HVAC blower motor market can be divided into two types: brushed and brushless. Brushed motors use carbon brushes to supply power to the motor's rotor, creating friction and causing wear over time. On the other hand, brushless motors use electronic commutation to power the rotor, eliminating the need for brushes. Brushless motors tend to be more efficient, reliable, and quieter than brushed motors. However, brushed motors are typically less expensive and simpler in design. Both types are commonly used in automotive HVAC systems for air circulation.</p></p>
