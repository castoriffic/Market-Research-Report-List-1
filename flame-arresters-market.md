<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Arresters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Type Flame Arresters</li><li>Wet-Type Flame Arresters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame arresters are safety devices used to prevent the propagation of flame into a pipeline or vessel. Dry-type flame arresters are installed in pipelines containing flammable gases and vapors, where they extinguish flames by disrupting the flame front and cooling the gases. Wet-type flame arresters, on the other hand, are used in vessels containing flammable liquids and work by quenching the flame through submerging it in a liquid. Both types serve the same purpose of preventing the spread of fire and protecting equipment and personnel from potential explosions.</p></p>
