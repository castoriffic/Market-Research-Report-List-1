<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion-Assisted Deposition (IAD)</li><li>Electron Beam Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li><li>Vacuum Deposition</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ophthalmic Coating market includes several types of coating processes. Ion-Assisted Deposition (IAD) is a technique where ions are used to enhance the deposition of the coating material onto the surface. Electron Beam Evaporation involves the heating of a material until it evaporates and is then deposited onto the ophthalmic surface. Sputtering is a process where ions are bombarded onto a target material, causing it to eject particles which then settle on the surface. Vacuum Deposition is a general term for any method that involves depositing a material onto a surface in a vacuum environment.</p></p>
