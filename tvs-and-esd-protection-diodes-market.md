<p><strong>The TVS and ESD Protection Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ESD Protection Diodes</li><li>TVS Diodes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>TVS diodes, also known as transient voltage suppression diodes, are electronic components used for protecting sensitive devices from overvoltage transients. They provide fast response times and low clamping voltages to divert excessive voltage away from the protected device. On the other hand, ESD protection diodes, or electrostatic discharge diodes, are designed to dissipate electrostatic discharges that could potentially damage electronic components. These diodes offer reliable protection by shunting high energy ESD transients away from sensitive circuitry. Both TVS and ESD protection diodes play crucial roles in safeguarding electronic devices from voltage spikes and electrostatic discharges, respectively.</p></p>
