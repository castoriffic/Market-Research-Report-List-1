<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermoplastic Engine Cover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Casting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The thermoplastic engine cover market consists of two main types: injection molding and casting. Injection molding involves injecting molten thermoplastic material into a mold, which then solidifies to form the engine cover. This method allows for high precision and complex designs. On the other hand, casting involves pouring liquid thermoplastic into a mold and letting it cool and solidify. This method is suitable for large, less complex engine covers. Both methods are widely used in the market, catering to different production needs.</p></p>
