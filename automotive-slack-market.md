<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Slack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Slack Adjuster</li><li>Automatic Slack Adjuster</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive slack market consists of two main types: manual slack adjusters and automatic slack adjusters. Manual slack adjusters are adjusted by hand using a wrench or other tool and require periodic maintenance to ensure proper brake shoe clearance. On the other hand, automatic slack adjusters use self-adjusting mechanisms to maintain the correct brake shoe clearance automatically as the brakes wear down. Automatic slack adjusters offer convenience and improved safety by reducing the risk of brake shoe drag and excessive brake lining wear.</p></p>
