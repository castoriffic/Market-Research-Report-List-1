<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galactosidase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alpha Galactosidase</li><li>Beta Galactosidase</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The galactosidase market comprises two types: alpha galactosidase and beta galactosidase. Alpha galactosidase is an enzyme that helps in the digestion of certain carbohydrates, particularly in individuals with conditions like lactose intolerance. It breaks down complex sugars into simpler forms for better absorption. On the other hand, beta galactosidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of lactose, which is the sugar found in milk. It helps individuals who have lactose intolerance to digest dairy products more effectively. Both types of galactosidase find applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p></p>
