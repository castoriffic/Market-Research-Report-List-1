<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distance Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasonic Distance Meter</li><li>Laser Distance Meter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The distance meter market consists of two main types: Ultrasonic Distance Meter and Laser Distance Meter. Ultrasonic Distance Meters use sound waves to measure distances. They emit sound pulses, and the device calculates the distance based on the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back. On the other hand, Laser Distance Meters use laser beams to measure distances. These devices emit laser pulses and measure the time it takes for the laser beams to reflect off a target and return. Both types serve a similar purpose, but they utilize different technologies for distance measurement.</p></p>
