<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile HVAC Heat Exchangers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condenser</li><li>Heat Core</li><li>Evaporator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile HVAC heat exchangers can be categorized into three types: Condenser, Heat Core, and Evaporator. A condenser is responsible for transferring heat from the refrigerant to the outside air, enabling the refrigerant to cool down and liquefy. A heat core functions as a heater for the vehicle, transferring heat from the engine coolant to warm up the interior. Lastly, an evaporator is responsible for cooling the air inside the vehicle, as it absorbs heat from the cabin and transfers it to the refrigerant, resulting in cooler air circulation.</p></p>
