<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Off-highway Dump Truck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Frame</li><li>Articulating Frame</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Off-highway dump trucks are widely used in construction and mining industries for hauling heavy loads. The market is divided into two types based on the frame design: rigid frame and articulating frame. Rigid frame dump trucks have a fixed chassis, providing maximum stability and load capacity, making them suitable for large-scale operations. Articulating frame dump trucks have a pivot joint that allows the front and rear sections to articulate, increasing maneuverability and versatility in tight spaces or uneven terrain. Both types have their own unique advantages and are chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
