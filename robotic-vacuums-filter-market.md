<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robotic Vacuums Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Washable Type</li><li>Non-washable Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Robotic vacuums filters can be categorized into two types: washable and non-washable. Washable filters are designed to be cleaned and reused multiple times, eliminating the need for frequent replacements. This type of filter is typically made of durable materials that can withstand washing without losing their efficiency. On the other hand, non-washable filters are generally disposable and need to be replaced once they become dirty or clogged. While they offer convenience, non-washable filters may result in additional costs due to regular replacements.</p></p>
