<p><strong>The Triple Superphosphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular</li><li>Non-granular</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Triple superphosphate (TSP) is a popular phosphate fertilizer used in agriculture. The market for TSP can be categorized into two types: granular and non-granular. Granular TSP refers to the fertilizer in a solid, small-sized form, while non-granular TSP is powdered or flake-like. Granular TSP is preferred by some farmers as it provides uniform spreading and minimal dust during application. Non-granular TSP, on the other hand, is commonly used in liquid fertilizers or as an ingredient in blended fertilizers. Both types offer balanced nutrient content and are essential for promoting plant growth and enhancing agricultural productivity.</p></p>
