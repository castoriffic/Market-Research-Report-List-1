<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stem cell cryopreservation equipment can be categorized into two types: liquid phase and vapor phase. In liquid phase cryopreservation, the stem cells are stored in a cryoprotective solution and placed in a liquid nitrogen-filled tank to maintain a low temperature. Vapor phase cryopreservation involves storing the stem cells above the surface of the liquid nitrogen, ensuring no direct contact with the liquid nitrogen. Both types of equipment are used for long-term storage of stem cells, preserving their viability and allowing for future use in medical research or treatments.</p></p>
