<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum (PET) Coke Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Calcined Coke</li><li>Fuel Grade</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Petroleum coke, commonly known as pet coke, is a carbonaceous solid derived from crude oil refining. It is classified into two main types: Calcined Coke and Fuel Grade coke. Calcined coke is produced through a high-temperature thermal process, resulting in a higher carbon content and improved physical and chemical properties, making it suitable for various industrial applications. Fuel Grade coke, on the other hand, has a lower carbon content and is primarily used as a fuel source in power plants and cement kilns.</p></p>
