<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lab Scale Tablet Presses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-punch</li><li>Rotary</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Lab scale tablet presses are used in pharmaceutical and research laboratories to produce small batches of tablets for testing and experimentation. There are two main types of lab scale tablet presses: single-punch and rotary. Single-punch tablet presses are relatively simple and suitable for low volume production, where a single tablet is produced with each cycle. Rotary tablet presses, on the other hand, are more complex and produce multiple tablets in each cycle. They are capable of higher production volumes and offer greater efficiency and speed compared to single-punch presses.</p></p>
