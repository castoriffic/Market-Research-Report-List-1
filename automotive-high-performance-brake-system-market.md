<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive High-Performance Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc brakes</li><li>Drum brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive high-performance brake system market comprises two main types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use a rotating disc and calipers to clamp down on the disc, creating friction and slowing down the vehicle. These brakes provide better performance and heat dissipation, making them suitable for high-performance vehicles. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoes that expand against a rotating drum to generate friction and stop the vehicle. Drum brakes are less effective in dissipating heat but are more cost-effective and commonly used in rear wheel applications.</p></p>
