<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asynchronous Wind Turbines</li><li>Synchronous Wind Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind turbines can be classified into two main market types: asynchronous and synchronous. Asynchronous wind turbines use an asynchronous generator to convert wind energy into electricity. They are known for their simple and robust design, making them suitable for a wide range of wind conditions. On the other hand, synchronous wind turbines utilize a synchronous generator that is connected to the grid. They are more efficient and offer better control over power generation. Both types play a vital role in harnessing wind energy and contributing to the global transition towards renewable sources.</p></p>
