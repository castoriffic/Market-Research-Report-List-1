<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caprolactum Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>From Phenol</li><li>From Cyclohexane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Caprolactam is a chemical compound used in the production of nylon. There are two main types of Caprolactam markets: those derived from phenol and those derived from cyclohexane. Caprolactam derived from phenol involves the conversion of phenol into hydroxycaproic acid, followed by a series of chemical reactions to produce Caprolactam. On the other hand, Caprolactam derived from cyclohexane involves the oxidation of cyclohexane to form a compound known as cyclohexanone, which is then converted into Caprolactam. Both types of markets are important for the production and supply of Caprolactam in various industries.</p></p>
