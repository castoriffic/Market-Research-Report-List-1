<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highway Hazard Marker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Lighting</li><li>Non-lighting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Highway hazard markers are essential for maintaining road safety. The market for these markers can be categorized into two types: lighting and non-lighting. Lighting markers are equipped with LED lights that enhance visibility, particularly during nighttime or adverse weather conditions. These markers play a vital role in preventing accidents and guiding drivers effectively. On the other hand, non-lighting markers do not include any lighting component but are typically made of reflective materials. They rely solely on the reflection of headlights to alert drivers about potential hazards on the road. Both lighting and non-lighting markers contribute significantly to road safety.</p></p>
