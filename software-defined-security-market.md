<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Software-Defined Security Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Premise</li><li>Cloud Deployment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Software-Defined Security (SDS) is a security approach that aims to centralize and automate security controls through software rather than relying on traditional hardware-based solutions. In terms of deployment, there are two main types: on-premise and cloud. On-premise deployment involves implementing the SDS solution within an organization's infrastructure, providing greater control over security measures but requiring more maintenance. Cloud deployment, on the other hand, utilizes the cloud infrastructure, offering flexibility, scalability, and ease of management through third-party service providers, but may raise concerns about data privacy and control. These two deployment options cater to different organizational needs and preferences.</p></p>
