<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) refers to an automobile that emits no tailpipe pollutants when driven. There are two main market types within the ZEV category: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs rely solely on electricity stored in their batteries and have no combustion engine, resulting in zero emissions. PHEVs, on the other hand, can run on both electricity and a conventional engine. While operating purely on electricity, PHEVs emit zero emissions, but their overall environmental impact varies depending on their usage of the combustion engine.</p></p>
