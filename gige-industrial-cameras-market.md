<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GigE Industrial Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD</li><li>CMOS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>GigE industrial cameras are categorized into two types: CCD and CMOS. CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) cameras use a technology where light photons are converted into electronic charges, which are then read out by the camera. This allows for high image quality, low noise, and wide dynamic range. On the other hand, CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) cameras utilize a different technology, where each pixel has its own amplifier and is read out individually. CMOS cameras generally offer faster readout speeds, lower power consumption, and are more cost-effective compared to CCD cameras.</p></p>
